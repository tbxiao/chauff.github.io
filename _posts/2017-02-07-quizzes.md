title: Quiz questions anyone?
---

I just finished this academic year's edition of *Big Data Processing*, a Bachelor course I have been teaching for a 
few years now. As I am not a big fan of teaching the same course for 5+ years, I am happy to move on to a different course 
next year - creating new lecture material, drawing up new assignments and generally having an excuse to dive into a new
area is still (and hopefully will always be) exciting to me!

Why am I writing this? Not to lament about teaching the same course(s) over and over, but to proivde some additional material
here. I already uploaded slides, assignments and exams 
on the [Teaching site](http://chauff.github.io/teaching/), the only missing item are the **weekly class quizzes** I ran. While 
quite a few of them were open-answer quizzes, nearly 70 were multiple-choice/multiple-answer. To make these
questions usable to others, I have converted them (with the help of the basic and very easy to use 
[quizgen](https://github.com/karanveerm/quizgen) tool) into actual interactive quizzes. 

Due to the limited export functionality of our LMS, I converted the question by hand, let me know if you find errors, there are probably a few!

It may take 1-2 questions until you understand the way the quiz shows the correct/incorrect answers; at least it took me
a few minutes to figure out why I saw so much red in my answers (focus on the small green ticks and red crosses, not so much
the giant green/red bars!). 

Having said that, here are the quizzes:

* [17 questions on streaming](http://chauff.github.io/documents/bdp-quiz/streaming.html)
* [29 questions on MapReduce/Hadoop](http://chauff.github.io/documents/bdp-quiz/hadoop.html)
* [9 questions on graphs and Giraph](http://chauff.github.io/documents/bdp-quiz/graph.html)
* [10 questions on Pig/Pig Latin](http://chauff.github.io/documents/bdp-quiz/pig.html)
