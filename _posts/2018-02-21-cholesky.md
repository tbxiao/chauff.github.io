title: Implementation of Cholesky decomposition
---

## Intro

In implementing the particle algorithm based on the Ellipsoidal Statistical Fokker-Planck model, a key step is to find a matrix L that satisfies the following relationship:

For this problem, the most intuitive method is obviously to open the matrix A, which needs to calculate the eigenvalue of A. In the advancement algorithm, it takes a lot of calculation time at each time step.

A possible alternative is the Cholesky decomposition, which is based on the decomposition of a positive definite Hermite matrix into a product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. This method of decomposition was originally invented by Andr√©-Louis Cholesky.
    
## Algorithm principle

The implementation of Cholesky decomposition can be based on the Cholesky-Crout algorithm.  
For a matrix that needs to be solved, it can be written in the following form:

The corresponding formula for the matrix L element is as follows,

## Numerical implementation

A subroutine based on Fortran90 is given below.   
Details can be found on [Github](https://github.com/vavrines/cholesky "Title").
