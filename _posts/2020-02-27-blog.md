It's been a while since I moved part of the work flow to Julia. I've been thinking about the particular advantages held by this *not-too-new* programming language.

In-built package manager [Pkg.jl](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/) (think about the endless melancholy between pip and conda...)  
Also see [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl/issues/3) for project and manifest management.

Easy to calculate $Ax=b$ by typing `A\b`
