“清歌唱宛转，春雨过铃鹿。”  —— 夏目漱石

A Ph.D. candidate in Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science at Peking University,
and a Research Assistant in Department of Mathematics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
My research interest includes 1) numerical and applied analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations, hyperbolic conservation laws, kinetic theory of gases and uncertainty quantification; 2) multiscale modeling and computational study of fluid mechanics, photon transports and plasma physics.

I guess we could sit down and talk something about artistic photography as amateur.
