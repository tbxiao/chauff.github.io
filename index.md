“清歌唱宛转，春雨过铃鹿。”  —— 夏目漱石

An Research Associate in Steinbuch Centre for Computing and Department of Mathematics at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
I received my doctorate in Fluid Mechanics from Peking University,
and I worked as a Research Assistant in Department of Mathematics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
My research interest includes 1) numerical and applied analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations, hyperbolic conservation laws, kinetic theory of gases and uncertainty quantification; 2) multiscale modeling and computational study of fluid mechanics, photon transports and plasma physics.

I guess we could sit down and talk something about artistic photography as amateur.
