## News
- Three colleagues and I have set up a monthly [Delft AI meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Delft-AI-Meetup/). Join it if you are a local!
- [Blog post](https://chauff.github.io/2018-11-04-emnlp/) on EMNLP 2018 is up!
- As of October 2018 I have finally created [extensive lectures materials](https://github.com/chauff/Web-Teaching) (assignments, transcripts, demo applications) for my first year BSc Computer Science & Engineering web technology lectures. 
- If you are interested in a **PhD or Postdoc position in information retrieval and related areas** (NLP, data science) please get in touch!
- Our paper *Contrasting search as a learning activity with instructor-designed learning* led by Felipe Moraes with Sindunuraga Rikarno Putra, a Master student in my team, as second author, accepted as a full paper at **CIKM 2018** ([blog post](https://chauff.github.io/2018-08-07-sal-at-cikm/)). 
- Two demos of my team made an appearance at SIGIR 2018: a collaborative search (on GitHub: [frontend](https://github.com/felipemoraes/searchx-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/felipemoraes/searchx-backend)) and an A/B testing framework (also on [GitHub](https://marrerom.github.io/APONE/))

## Briefly

Since 2013, I have been working as staff member (Assistant Prof since 2013, tenured as of 2016 and Associate as of 2018) at the [Web Information Systems group](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/),
 [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/). Between 2011 and 2012 I was a Postdoc in the same group.
I received my PhD in 2010 from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/), where I worked in the 
[Human Media Interaction group](http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/). 
The [Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg](https://www.uni-magdeburg.de/) in Germany was 
my home during my undergraduate years as a student in computer science.
In the past, I have worked on a variety of topics in the fields of information retrieval & data science, 
including query performance prediction (the topic of [my PhD thesis](../documents/publications/thesis.pdf)), 
social search, computational social science, 
learning to search and IR for specific user groups.

I have diverse research interests and am always happy to dive into a new area. Together with four PhD students I am currently focusing on large-scale learning analytics and how to incorporate search into the learning process at scale. In 2016 and 2017 I have been awarded two prestigious personal grants by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) with a total funding of more than 1 million euros; this translates into 4-5 PhD/postdoc positions in the developing "search as learning" research area; take a look at the [Dagstuhl Seminar](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=17092) I co-organized on the topic to get an idea of what it is about. TU Delft is a very active provider of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on the edX platform, which provides a rich experimental playground for my [Lambda-Lab](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/projects/lambda-lab/) team. To get a quick overview of the kind of questions we have recently published about, take a look at the following slides, they cover each contribution in 1-2 slides (check the speaker notes as well):

I also recently gave an invited keynote at the French IR conference [CORIA 2018](https://project.inria.fr/coriataln2018/fr/) on the topic of Search as Learning:
